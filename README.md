### What Can It Do?

EMCE is a mod designed as an add-on for [EarthMC](https://earthmc.net/) with features such as:
- Commands
  - /queuesize, /nationinfo, /towninfo, /townless & /nearby.
  - Use /townless inviteAll to quickly invite townless people to your town!
- On-Screen Info
  - Townless - All online townless players are shown on your screen.
  - Nearby - See anyone whose close to you without checking the dynmap! Configurable options include: radius, rank and distance.
  - News - Sometimes it's hard to keep up with the news. EMCE sends news to your action bar (or chat) as soon as it is reported.
